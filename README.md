# pinUp

<img src="README-assets/metaswarm-wireframing-10.png"/>

Prototype for a data-driven explorer for visual presentation.  This project addresses the immediate and practical need for a presentation format better suited to meet needs of architects and visual designers, who typically come from culture of physical pinups, and are now underwhelmed and frustrated by limitations of current slide-based (powerpoint) and single-canvas (prezi) presentation formats. In contrast, pinUp encourages use of multiple canvases and multiple threads of visual narrative, and in this way it is uniquely multi-scalar and non-linear in format. The project's initial aim is to design and develop minimal working prototype, which will serve as proof of concept and test bed for subsequent develop cycles. The ultimate goal of this project is the development of a web-based client that will allow users to quickly build interactive mixed-media narrative experiences for presentation and exhibition of mostly visual content.

## Getting Started

### Dependancies

pinUp requires the following AS3 libraries:

```
GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)
```

### How to use tool

<!-- Open sandbox.3dm, launch grasshopper and open sandbox.gh. Should have something like this: -->

## Roadmap

<!-- Would like to develop this into fully integrated system for subterrainian architecture, that allows users to manipulate user/building constraints in real-time and outputs closed mesh massing for rapid prototyping, and perhaps generates complete set of shop drawings for fabrication :). If you are interested in helping please let me know. -->
